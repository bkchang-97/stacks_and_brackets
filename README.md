# stacks_and_brackets

This is an example of a PrairieLearn question I have developed for UBC's CPSC 203. It is based on the popular algorithms question "Valid Parentheses" and asks a student to determine the maximum number of items that will be pushed onto a stack structure given an input string. The string itself is randomized along with its corresponding answer. The server code can be found in **server.py** while the code for rendering the question is located in **question.html**
